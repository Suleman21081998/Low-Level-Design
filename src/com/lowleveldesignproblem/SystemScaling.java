    Horizontal scaling:
      1.When new server racks are added to the existing system to meet the higher expectation, it is known as horizontal scaling.
      2.It is easier to upgrade but difficult to implement
      3.It is costlier, as new server racks comprise a lot of resources.It takes more time to be done
      4.High resilience and fault tolerance
      5.Examples of databases that can be easily scaled- Cassandra, MongoDB, Google Cloud Spanner

    Vertical scaling:
     1.When new resources are added in the existing system to meet the expectation, it is known as vertical scaling
     2.It is difficult to upgrade , may involve downtime but easier to implement
     3.It is cheaper as we need to just add new resources. It takes less time to be done
     4.Single point of failure
     5.Examples  of databases that can be easily scaled- MySQL, Amazon RDS
